# Healthcare Readmission Analysis and Resource Optimization

## Overview
This project analyzes hospital readmission rates and length of stay for various medical conditions using a Kaggle dataset. The goal is to identify patterns, recommend improvements to patient care, and optimize resource allocation.

## Key Findings
1. High Readmission Rates: 
   - Conditions with high readmissions: Obesity, Cancer, Hypertension, Asthma.
   - Recommendation: Improve post-discharge follow-up care and investigate treatment protocols.

2. Average Length of Stay: 
   - Most conditions had an average length of stay of ~2 weeks.
   - Recommendation: Optimize resource allocation and reduce LOS to improve patient turnover.

3. Demographic Trends:
   - Cancer: Higher readmissions among males.
   - Obesity: Higher readmissions among females.
   - Recommendation: Further research into gender-specific causes.
